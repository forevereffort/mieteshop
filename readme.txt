 if you remember we moved the publishers from being a CPT to being a custom taxonomy (https://mieteshop.mystagingwebsite.com/wp-admin/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=ekdotes&post_type=product). So you will probably have to change the search code to search in product custom taxonomy for publishers

 Also please remember to remove publisher CPT (Εκδότες) and its custom taxonomy (located here https://mieteshop.mystagingwebsite.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=publisher)
